### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find out if it would be prudent to open a ice cream and surf shop in Oahu. The client has had previous shops lose business due to adverse weather conditions, and wants to avoid any weather related problems with this shop. By looking at weather and precipitation trends by month, it is easier to see how weather conditions could potentially impact a business that relies so heavily on foot-traffic.
