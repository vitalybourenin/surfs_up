### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find out if it would be prudent to open a ice cream and surf shop in Oahu. The client has had previous shops lose business due to adverse weather conditions, and wants to avoid any weather related problems with this shop. By looking at weather and precipitation trends by month, it is easier to see how weather conditions could potentially impact a business that relies so heavily on foot-traffic.


## Results
- By looking at temperatures in Oahu during June and December we see that there is not much variation in temperature between the Summer and Winter months in Oahu. The median temperature for June was 75 degrees, and dropped by just four degrees during December.  
- With June and December representing months that are essential to business due to tourists, it is a promising sign that the variation in temperature is so low. 
- With fairly warm temperatures in both the Summer and Winter, there is nothing in the temperature data to show that it would have a negative impact on business. 

# Summary
- While the results look promising for the business, it is important to note that this analysis should not be the deciding factor in whether the shop should be opened. 
- Further analysis on percipitation rates as well as non-weather-related factors should be considered as well. 
- Further queries might include extracting the months into groups of four by season, which would provide further insight into how temperature and percipitation changes   throughout the year. Additionally, a query that extracted only the months with the most expected business would be useful to see if there were any previous concerning weather patterns during these months in Oahu.
